This survey was done in the context of "Usable Security Lab" at Leibniz University Hannover.\
We tested the usability of Yubikeys as passwordless authentication method by using them as "Passkeys".\
The aim of the study was to replicate the results of the Paper ["Is FIDO2 the Kingslayer of User Authentication? A Comparative 
Usability Study of FIDO2 Passwordless Authentication"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SP40000.2020.00047)
